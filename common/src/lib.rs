//! Types and utilities shared between the frontend and the worker.
//!
//! The Web Worker that executes and compiles user code communicates with the
//! browser frontend exclusively through the [`WorkerRequest`] and
//! [`WorkerResponse`] enums defined in this crate. The frontend serializes a
//! [`WorkerRequest`] and posts it to the worker, which replies with serialized
//! [`WorkerResponse`] values. Each message variant documents one step of the
//! compilation or language-server lifecycle that drives the IDE.
